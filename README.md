# Bitcoin
On October 31, 2008 an unknown person called Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” to the cyberpunks mailing list. In eight pages (Nakamoto, 2008), Satoshi explained transactions, network, incentives, and other building blocks of a digital currency that he called Bitcoin.
Bitcoin solves the problem of sending and receiving digital currency on the world wide web. 

Bitcoin and Blockchain have been used interchangeably in the past, but Bitcoin is only a financial application of blockchain technology. Blockchain uses an underlying peer-to-peer network to transmit blocks and proposed transactions between blockchain users worldwide. We will elaborate on “users” in later sections, however, users of the first blockchain, Bitcoin, are ordinary web users who can join the network by downloading and installing an application that is called a wallet. The technology uses three fundamental concepts: address, transaction, and block.
